# LBP Descriptor CUDA
Project for the Parallel Computing exam at the University of Florence.

The sequential and first parallel implementations for the same project can be find here: [LBP descriptor](https://github.com/matpetrone/LBP_Descriptor).

Local binary patterns (LBP) is a type of visual descriptor used for classification in computer vision. It has since been found to be a powerful feature for texture classification.
